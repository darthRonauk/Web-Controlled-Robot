# Web-Controlled-Robot
Imagine your house as a web site. Like your house address, you have a web address (url). To go to your house you go to that particular address. Once you visit the site you find a homepage in front of you that contains links to other pages. Now imagine all electronics items that you use on a daily basis are web pages on that site. And you find buttons on every page that lets you operate these electronic devices through these web pages. Sounds crazy? Doesn't it?  Well this mechanism could be possible with a peer knowledge on HTML, the language that lets you build and design websites, as well as a bit of servlets and JSP technology. Inorder to use this mechanism to operate home appliances via a website, first a platform or a base is needed. For that purpose, I have created a base project a.k.a. "Web controlled Robot".
